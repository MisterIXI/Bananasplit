# Bananasplit

Bananasplit is a custom Splitter (like [livesplit](http://livesplit.org/)) for Speedrunning the All Cup Tour Category in  "Mario Kart: Double Dash!!".
See the leaderboard here: http://www.speedrun.com/mkdd#All_Cup_Tour

# Why not just use Livesplit then?
The ACT (all cup tour) has a random track order (except for the first and last), which means that you can't just split per Track and see how well you're doing. 

Banasplit requires you to select the Track and then compares the times like Livesplit and similar splitters do.


Banasplit is a WPF Application written in C# with Visual Studio.
